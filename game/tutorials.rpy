    m "一个 Mod 的根，就是一个小小的 label。"
    m "没有它，Ren'Py 就没法让我们享受充满交互感的游戏。"
    m "那么 label 到底是什么呢？"
    m "简单来说，label 就是一个脚本集，游戏就是通过一个个 label 实现各种操作逻辑的。"
    m "通过 jump、call 来呼唤这些 label，游戏就会加载出正确的内容。"
    m "那么知道了 label 这种东西的含义后，我们就可以开始写 Mod 了。"
    m 2c "但是写 Mod 时，你还需要当心。"
    m "因为一个错误，有可能导致 Mod 无法运行。"
    m "而且由于技术力限制，你可能很难找到错误所对应的地方。"
    m "还请大佬能给个 Pull Request 进行解决呐..."
    m 3a "接下来，我们就可以做一个 Mod 了！"
    m 1a "不过，既然大家都要虚心，那么咱们还是来点简单的吧。"
    m 1h "因为我没有能直接调用 Ren'Py 的超能力，所以你一定要跟紧我啊！"
    m "首先，我也知道你已经跟着 README 一步步做了。"
    m "那么，给你的工程文件夹命名吧！我们这里以 \"Forever Life\" 为例。"
    m 2a "接下来，你可以直接把 'tutorial.rpy' 和 'tutorial.rpyc' 删掉了。它们只是这个教程的组成部分，接下来用不到。当然，你也可以留着。"
    m 3a "接下来用你最爱的编辑器打开 'script.rpy' 这个文件。"
    m "跳转到第 26 行。你应该可以看到我贴心的注释。接下来，你只需要改动第 26 - 29 行，也就是注释包住的地方。"
    m "接下来，删掉这几行，然后新开一行。你可能需要再打 4 个空格。"
    m "如果你使用 VS Code，那么它应该就已经把 4 个空格的缩进整好了。实在没有，可以按 Tab 键补全。"
    m "输入：\n' \ \ \ call meet_monika'\n（不要把引号也打进去）"
    m "顺便插一句嘴：Python 对空格十分敏感，所以一定要记得空格！"
    m "而且，传统的“Tab”缩进会导致 Mod 罢工哦！"
    m 1j "...抱歉，扯远了..."
    m "接下来，保存文件。"
    m 3a "然后，再新建一个文件，命名为 'meet_monika.rpy'，记得扩展名！"
    m "顺便，.rpy 文件就是 Ren'Py 里的脚本源代码文件。"
    m "打开刚刚创建的文件，输入：\n'label meet_monika:'"
    m "换行，然后：\n' \ \ \ return'"
    m "保存。"
    m 4i "好的，这就是一个异常简单的，啥都没有的 label 了！"
    m 1a "接下来，我就解释一下 Ren'Py 的跳转逻辑吧。"
    m 3a "你刚刚写的 call meet_monika 其实就是一个跳转到 label 'meet_monika' 的操作。"
    m "在 Ren'Py 里，跳转可以使用 call 或者 jump，但两者有很大不同。"
    m "call 相当于打开一个新的子窗口，可以通过 return 来返回上一级。"
    m "但 jump 相当于在当前页面打开新页面，return 之后就相当于整个窗口被关掉。"
    m 1a "至于 call 后面加 from 从句的事情，反正我懒得做，毕竟打包时 Ren'Py 会自动补全的。"
    m 4b "但是，如果你直接着急地尝试自己的 Mod，恐怕你只能在主菜单反复横跳，因为刚刚的 label 没有东西。"
    m "如果出现报错，你有可能需要检查一下自己有没有打错什么东西，毕竟我动不了你的文本编辑器..."
    m 2a "不过，如果你还是没法解决的话，那么可以去 answers 文件夹里找到答案喵。"
    m "顺便解释一下那些带井号的东西：它们是 Python 里的注释。为了避免冲突，我就暂时把这些东西注释掉了。"

    # m "Hi again [player]!"
    # m 1a "If the last part was a bit too hard, don’t worry, this part is easier."
    # m "Like last time, I’ll tell you what to do and then I’ll explain, okay?"
    # m 4a "First open monika_route_script.rpy."
    # m "Between the first line and 'return', add the line \n' \ \ \ stop music fadeout 2.0'"

    # m "Try to launch the game with Ren’Py and see what happens..."
    # m 2c "..."
    # m 1c "Does it work? If everything goes well, you should be listening to Sayori’s main theme."
    # m 3a "There’s just one dialogue, so if you click one time, you go to the main menu because of the 'return' keyword."
    # m 3b "Okay, time to explain what happened!"
    # m 3a "Let’s look at ' \ \ \ stop music fadeout 2.0'. Before you click New Game, you can hear the music of the main menu, right? "
    # m "But when you click New Game, the music stops progressively."
    # m 4a "That’s due to 'stop music fadeout 2.0'. 'stop music' tells the current music to stop. 'fadeout 2.0' makes it so the current music completely becomes silent in 2 seconds."
    # m 4b "'fadeout' isn’t necessary but smooth transitions are much more pleasant, aren’t they?"
    # m 4a "The next line ' \ \ \ play music t2' tells the game to play the music named 't2'. You’re surely wondering what’s 't2'. 't2' refers to Sayori theme, 'Ohayou Sayori!'."
    # m 3a "Besides Ohayou Sayori, there are many other songs. But each one is labeled by their own nickname."
    # m "You can see the list of every music with their nickname in definitions.rpy"
    # m "You can find definitions.rpy inside the folder advanced_scripts which should be in the DDLC Mod Template's directory."
    # m 2a "Try finding it and then open it."
    # m "Find the lines beginning by 'define audio'. This is where each music gets assigned a nickname."
    # m "For example, in the case of the main theme, its nickname is 't1'. In the case of Confession, its nickname is 't10'."
    # m 5a "Can you now guess what happens if you type 'play music t1' instead of 'play music t2'?"
    # m 1k "Confession is played instead of Ohayou Sayori!"
    # m 2a "Instead of using nickname, you can directly write the path of the music."
    # m "Try writing 'play music '<loop 4.499>bgm/2.ogg'' instead of 'play music t2'."
    # m 2b "See? Ohayou Sayori! is played. Try one last thing for me okay? Write ''<from 50.0>bgm/credits.ogg'' instead of ''<loop 4.499>bgm/2.ogg''."
    # m 5a "Have you already heard this song?"
    # m 1b "This is the song I wrote just for you. I really hope you like it. I worked very hard on it you know."
    # m 1e "..."
    # m 4a "The last line you wrote, ' \ \ \ mc 'Let's listen to the music.', makes the main character says 'Let's listen to the music.'. I’ll explain how dialogue works later so bear with me okay?"
    # m 2a "Alright, before finishing this tutorial, replace ''play <from 50.0>bgm/credits.ogg'' by 'play music t2'."

    m 3a "As you can see, I gave you several choices and you picked one of them."
    m "That’s what I’m going to teach you."
    m 4a "Like every time, open monika_route_script.rpy and between 'return' and the last line before it,-"
    m "- add ' \ \ \ menu:', jump a line and then enter below \n' \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ mc 'I told her to meet me...''. Be careful, this time, there are eight spaces."
    m "Write just under \n' \ \ \ \ \ \ 'At the literature club room':' and then \n' \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ meeting_place = 'club_room''."
    m 4b "Type \n' \ \ \ \ \ \ 'In front of my house':' and under it \n' \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ meeting_place = 'my_house'."
    m 4a "Finally, jump a line and add ' \ \ \ mc 'I can't wait to meet her!''."
    m 2a "Try to play the game."
    m "If it doesn’t work, there’s surely an indentation error."
    m 5a "I can’t help you from here, but you can check T5.rpy for the answers. You know where it is, right?"
    m 4b "Okay, the lines you wrote made the game offers two choices. The two choices are preceded by an explanative sentence, 'I told her to meet me...'."
    m "You can specify who says this sentence by adding a nickname like 'mc' before it. It’s just like a dialogue. What’s important is that this sentence is written before any choice."
    m 3a "Contrary to the explanative sentence, the choices mustn’t be preceded by a nickname. They should be enclosed in quotation marks. Just after the closing quotation mark, there must be a ':' ."
    m "After ':, the next lines should have one more indent than the choice. It means these lines will be read if the player selects that choice."
    m 3b "I’ll give more explanation about the meaning of indents in the next tutorial."
    m 3a "In our case, the next line after the first choice is \n' \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ meeting_place = 'club_room'."
    m 2a "Take a good look at this line."
    m 3b "Until now, I referred 'mc', 'bg residential' and 't2' as nickname. But that’s not really the correct word. They are actually what we call variable."
    m "Variable in coding is a very important concept. They have many forms and do many things. They can be ‘nicknames’ or they can be numbers or more complicated structures."
    m 1a "A full Python tutorial would be necessary to explain everything but...for now, I will only teach what’s necessary to make a DDLC mod, okay?"
    m 1c "I myself don’t know Python and Ren’Py all that well after all..."
    m 3a "'meeting_place' is like the variables we saw before. It refers to a name, in more exact terms, a string (of characters): 'club_room'."
    m "Its default value is None which means it doesn’t exist."
    m 3e "Hold on a second? How can it not exist, you say?"
    m 1a "Well before you define it, the variable doesn’t exist. But if you later try to use it, for example in a conditional statement, the variable will be ‘created’ and its value will be None."
    m "It’s alright if you don’t understand it yet. Variable, conditional statement and None will become clearer in my next lecture."
    m 4b "Let’s go back to the meaning of ' $ meeting_place = 'club_room'. Here we create the variable 'meeting_place' and assign it the string 'club_room'."
    m 4m "The '$' in front of it is to tell Ren’Py the line is a Python line. Um..., I can’t really explain why we need to do that if you don’t know python yet..."
    m 4a "Just remember that you need to add '$' when you want to assign a variable a value that way"
    m "Regarding the second choice, the structure is the same. The only difference is that the value of 'meeting_place' will be 'my_house' if the player selects the second choice."
    m "After the second choice, the game executes the line ' \ \ \ mc 'I can't wait to meet her!''."
    m 1a "For now it doesn’t look like the choices did anything. But we actually assigned 'meeting_place' either 'club_room' or 'my_house'."
    m 3a "We have to wait until the next tutorial to see how we can use the variable 'meeting_place'."
    m 3b "Alright, I’m sorry to leave hanging like that I believe we need to take a little break."
    m "If you want though, I would more than happy to begin the next part right away!"
    m 5a "Just click Part 6!"

    m 1m "Well, this one is going to be hard as well but..."
    m 1b "Hang it there okay? We did the hardest part already!"
    m 1a "Last time we saw how to add menu and how to assign variable a value."
    m 1b "Let’s see how we can use these variables!"
    m 2a "You know the drill, open monika_route_script.rpy and at the end of the file, just before 'return'..."
    m 4a "Add the following lines :"
    m "' \ \ \ if meeting_place == 'club_room':',"
    m "' \ \ \ scene bg club_day',"
    m "' \ \ \ with wipeleft_scene',"
    m "' elif meeting_place == 'my_house':',"
    m "' \ \ \ scene bg house',"
    m "' \ \ \ with wipeleft_scene',"
    m " ' \ \ \ stop music fadeout 2.0',"
    m " ' \ \ \ play music t2',"
    m " 'mc 'She is already waiting for me when I arrive.''."
    m 2a "That was the last one. Save the file and try to play the game."
    m 5a "If it doesn’t work, you know where you can see the answer, don’t you?"
    m 2a "You already know how scene, transition, music and dialogue work so I won’t go over it again."
    m 4b "It’s not like I don’t want spend more time with you but you know, ... I’m excited to finish my route too!"
    m 4a "Okay, so the new thing is the 'if' statement. We call that a conditional statement. It’s an elementary and essential operation in programming."
    m "It goes basically like this: IF something_is_true THEN something_happens. In our case, if the meeting_place is 'club_rooom', then the scene changes to the club room."
    m 3a "Otherwise, if meeting_place is 'my_house' then the scene changes to the main character’s house."
    m 3b "It seems simple, right?"
    m 3a "The syntax must be as follow: first, there must be a 'if' followed by an equality which is either 'True' or 'False'. For example, 'meeting_place == 'club_room''."
    m "If 'meeting_place' was assigned 'club_room' before then the equality returns 'True'. Otherwise, its returns False."
    m "If the equality returns True then the game will read the lines belonging to the if bloc."
    m 4a "You can see where those lines are because they have one more indent compared to the if statement preceding them."
    m 4b "We once again meet the system of indent and block. This is one of the property of Python and Ren’Py. Let’s do a quick exercise."
    m "Can you see difference between:"
    m 2a " ' \ \ \ if meeting_place == 'club_room':' , \n' \ \ \ scene bg club_day ', \n' \ \ \ mc 'We will meet at the club room.''."
    m "And ' \ \ \ if meeting_place == 'club_room':' , \n' \ \ \ scene bg club_day ', ' mc 'We will meet at the club room.''?"
    m 4b "In the first case, the main character only says they will meet at the club room if 'meeting_place' is equal to 'club_room'."
    m "In the second case, he will say it no matter the value of 'meeting_place'."
    m 3a "You can see once again how important indentations are in Python."
    m 4b "About the second comparison, 'elif meeting_place == 'my_house'', note that we use 'elif' at the beginning instead of 'if'."
    m 4a "The difference between 'elif' and 'if' is subtle. First, you can only use 'elif' after you already wrote 'if'."
    m "Second, the statement following 'elif' won’t be evaluated if the previous if statement was True. Other than that, 'elif' works like 'if'."
    m 1b "Well, in our case it doesn’t matter because if 'meeting_place' is 'club_room' then 'meeting_place' cannot be 'my_house' at the same time."
    m 1a "It would matter if it was something like..."
    m "' \ \ \ if monika_affection_points > 10:' , \n' \ \ \ scene bg house', '' if monika_affection_points > 6:' , \n' \ \ \ scene club_day '."
    m 3a "In that case, if 'monika_affection_points' is higher than 10, the new scene wouldn’t be the house but the club because the game will evaluate both if."
    m 4b "To avoid that, 'elif' should be used instead of 'if'."
    m 4a "Besides 'if' and 'elif', there’s also the keyword 'else'. Like 'elif', 'else' can be used after a if. The bloc under 'else' will be executed if the previous if or elif statements are False."
    m 2a "For example..."
    m "' \ \ \ if meeting_place == 'club_room':' , \n' \ \ \ scene bg club_day ', ' \ \ \ else:' , \n' \ \ \ scene club_day '."
    m 1a "Well, there are more things to say about conditional statement..."
    m "For example about the keywords 'and' and 'or'..."
    m 3a "But let’s keep that for another time. I’m sure you can find more tutorial on Python and conditional statement."
    m 1b "For now, let’s move on! It’s about time we add character pictures into the game!"

    m "Hi [player]!"
    m "It’s about time we add character pictures, don’t you think?"
    m 1b "In the world of visual novel, we call them sprites. Sprites are 2D pictures of characters with generally a set of poses and expressions."
    m "In Doki Doki Literature Club, there are 4 characters, Sayori, Natsuki, Yuri and me. Each character has about 5 poses and 18 expressions."
    m 1e "So each character has about 900 combinations! That seems a lot but...when you’re actually inside the game, the lack of freedom becomes horribly frustrating..."
    m 1f "I really wish I could show you different expressions, poses and clothes but unfortunately, I can’t add myself new artwork to the game..."
    m 5a "If you’re an artist, I would really love it if you could add me more sprites!"
    m 2a "For our mod, we’ll only use existing art."
    m 4b "Let’s dot it! Open monika_route_script.rpy and before 'return', write:"
    m 4a "' \ \ \ show monika 1b at t11 zorder 2',"
    m "' \ \ \ m 'Hi [[player]!'',"
    m "' \ \ \ mc 'You're already here? I hope I didn't make you wait for too long.'',"
    m "' \ \ \ m 2a 'Don't worry, it's me who's early.'',"
    m "' \ \ \ show monika 5a at f11 zorder 3'."
    m 2a "Save, play the mod, and check T7.rpy if there’s an error."
    m 4b "Alright! The only new things are 'show monika 1b at t11 zorder 2' and 'm 2a'."
    m 4a "First, let’s go over 'show monika 1b at t11 zorder 2'."
    m "The keyword 'show' shows the sprite of the character named 'monika', with her pose '1' and her expression 'b'."
    m " The keyword 'at' specifies the position of the sprite. In the line above, the position is 't11'. 'zorder' has something to do with layers."
    m 3b "I’ll explain how positions and layers work in the next tutorial. For now, let’s focus on the poses and expressions of sprite."
    m 4a "Obviously, the variable 'monika' refers to me. Naturally, 'yuri' refers to Yuri and so on."
    m "If you write \n' \ \ \ show yuri 1b at f11 zorder 3' instead of \n' \ \ \ show monika 1b at f11 zorder 3', it’s Yuri who will appear."
    m 4k "Of course, you only have eyes for me so let’s not bother with the sprites of the other girls, ahaha!"
    m 5a "In my case, I have 5 different poses. I will show them to you one by one now."
    m 1a "This is my first pose."
    m 2a "This is my second pose."
    m 3a "This is my third pose."
    m 4a "This is my fourth pose."
    m 5a "This my fifth pose."
    m "I wonder which one do you prefer..."
    m 1a "Except for my fifth pose, all of my poses have 18 expressions. The expressions are referenced by a letter, from a to r. I will show them one by one."
    m 4a "Expression a."
    m 4b "Expression b."
    m 4c "Expression c"
    m 4d "Expression d."
    m 4e "Expression e."
    m 4f "Expression f."
    m 4g "Expression g."
    m 4h "Expression g."
    m 4i "Expression i."
    m 4j "Expression j."
    m 4k "Expression k."
    m 4l "Expression l."
    m 4m "Expression m."
    m 4n "Expression n."
    m 4o "Expression o."
    m 4p "Expression p."
    m 4q "Expression q."
    m 4r "Expression r."
    m 4a "You can find my list of expressions in 'MonikaCheatsheet.jpg' inside the mod's main directory."
    m 1b "I hope you will quickly memorize them perfectly!"
    m 5b "As my lover, you should know my face and my expressions without fail."
    m 3a "You can also find my poses and my expressions in definitions.rpy."
    m "My fifth pose only has the expressions a and b."
    m 5a "Like this."
    m 5b "And this."
    m 4a "My other poses have all expressions though."
    m 1b "Okay! In short, to show a sprite, you need to write 'show monika pose expression at t11 zorder 2'. Pose is either 1,2,3,4 or 5 and expression ranges from a to r."
    m "If you want to show several characters, just write 'show' several times, like this:"
    m 2a "' \ \ \ show yuri 1a at t41 zorder 2', ' \ \ \ show sayori 1a at t42 zorder 2', ' \ \ \ show monika 1a at t43 zorder 2', ' \ \ \ show natsuki 1a at t44 zorder 2'."
    m 2b "These lines will show Yuri, Sayori, me and Natsuki with their default pose and expression."
    m "After a sprite is already on the screen, there’s a shortcut to change her pose and expression."
    m 3a "Instead of using 'show' again and again, you can directly write the letter corresponding to the character followed by the number and the letter for their pose and expression."
    m "This is what we did in \n' \ \ \ m 2a 'Don't worry, it's me who's early.''."
    m 4g "Note that the sprite of the character speaking must already be on screeen."
    m 4e "If you try for example \n' \ \ \ y 2a 'Don't worry, it's me who's early.'', Yuri will speak but her sprite will not appear."
    m 3a "Keep in mind who’s on screen and who’s not at all time so as not to make a mistake."
    m 2a "...Never mind, actually just show my sprite. That way you don’t have to worry about such problem. It’s not like the other girls care about being shown anyway."
    m 1b "And that’s all for now! This tutorial was quite straightforward, especially considering the two last ones. I hope you liked it!"
    m "Next time, I’ll finish explaining positions and layers."

    m "Welcome back to our modding club!"
    m "Last time, we learnt about how to show sprite, now let’s learn how to place then."
    m 4a "Open monika_route_script.rpy and just before..."
    m 1b "Just kidding! Actually, you don’t have to add anything this time."
    m 3b "We already did it last tutorial after all."
    m 2a "So, do you remember the line \n' \ \ \ show monika 1b at t11 zorder 2'?"
    m "I said that 'at t11' was about position and that 'zorder 2' was about layer."
    m 2b "Let’s study in details what exactly that means."
    m 4b "’at' is a keyword that tells the game to put the sprite at the position 't11'."
    m "t11' is one of the position defined in Doki Doki Literature Club. There are more than 50 positions possible."
    m 4a "You can find the list of all defined positions in the script transforms.rpy. You can find it in the same folder as definitions.rpy."

    show monika 1a zorder 2 at t11

    m 1b "And that’s all for the 't' positions."
    m 4a "I think you guessed it already but 't11' should be used when there’s only one character."
    m "'t21' and 't22' should be used when there are two characters. 't21' is for the left, 't22' is for the right."
    m 3a "It’s the same logic for 't31','t32','t33'. 't31' is the left, 't32' the middle and 't33' the right. "
    m "'t41', 't42','t43' and 't44' work in the same way."
    m 3b "I encourage you to try these positions yourself with several characters. After all, there’s nothing better than practice to learn!"
    m 1a "If you remember well, we wrote one time ' show yuri 1b at f11 zorder 3'."
    m "Notice that the position is 'f11' instead of 't11'. The difference is just that 'f' positions are zoomed in. 'f' stands for focused. There are as many 'f' positions as 't' positions."
    m 4a "You should use 'f' position when there are several characters and when one of them speaks. The character speaking should be focused so that the player sees who’s talking."
    m 2b "Let’s talk about the keyword 'zorder' now."
    m 4a "When the game renders pictures, there’s an order."
    m "First, the background is rendered. Then the sprites and finally the U.I."
    m 4b "That’s why the sprites are on top of the background and the U.I on top of everything."
    m 2a "As you can see, order is very important. If the game renders background last, then you won’t be able to see anything else."
    m 3a "In Ren’Py the order of sprite is called zorder."
    m "You can specify the zorder of each sprite with the keyword zorder. The higher it is, the closer the sprite will be to the screen."
    m 4b "Try writing the following lines instead of 'show monika 1b at t11 zorder 2':"
    m 4a "' \ \ \ show monika 1a at t41 zorder 4',"
    m "' \ \ \ show yuri 1a at t42 zorder 3',"
    m "' \ \ \ show natsuki 1a at t43 zorder 2',"

    m 1a "Play the game and..."
    m 1b "Everyone is here!"
    m 3a "But that’s not the point. Pay attention to who’s on top on who."
    m "If you look closely, you can see the rendering order is like this : monika > yuri > natsuki > sayori."
    m "The one with the lowest zorder is rendered first so that the one with the highest zorder is shown on top of every other sprites."
    m 4a "If the zorder of two sprites are the same then the last sprite shown by 'show' will be on top."
    m 2b "Well, most of the time, you don’t have to worry about zorder. Just make sure I always have the highest zorder, okay?"
    m 1b "Alright! That ends this tutorial!"
    m 1a "Verify you reverted the changes you made to moninka_route_script.rpy. It should be like T8.rpy."
